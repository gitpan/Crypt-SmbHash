0.02  Mon Oct  8 12:07:08 2001
	- workaround for Digest::MD4, other machines didn't like the
		way I was calling it
0.12  Sun Oct 17 17:00:00 2004
	- Woke up from long sleep.
	- Finally applied patch supplied to me from
		Alexander Zangerl <az@snafu.priv.at>, for support of
		non-ascii characters, and correct handling for passwords
		like "0"
	- Included SMBNTEncrypt subroutine, which is used in
		challenge/response authentication. I added it and can't be
		bothered to take it out =)
