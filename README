Crypt/SmbHash version 0.01
==========================

This module provides functions to generate LM/NT hashes used in Samba's
'password' files, like smbpasswd.

The module is written entirely in perl, so it's a slower implementation
that if it was written in C, its easily ported and installed.

Example use:

   use Crypt::SmbHash;
   ntlmgen $ARGV[0], $lm, $nt;
   print "root:0:${lm}:${nt}:[U          ]:LCT-35463AFF\n";

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module should work out-of-the-box, although only tested with
perl 5.005 and perl 5.6.1

The generation of NT hashes requires an md4 algorithm, and although
Crypt::SmbHash has it's own version of md4 hashing, things are alot
faster if Digest::MD4 is installed aswell. Crypt::SmbHash will
automatically use Digest::MD4 if it detects that Digest::MD4 is
installed.
